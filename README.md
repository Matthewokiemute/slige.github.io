# slige.github.io

In this project it contains more of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with
a little bit of JavaScript.

This project is my first real website to test my web development skills.

But the organization I built it for isn't in operation anymore.

And I was given permission to share it as part of my projects that I have built.
